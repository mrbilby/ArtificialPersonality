    "Bot: Hey there! If you're heading out, that's totally cool. Just know I'm here if you have any questions or need assistance later. Have a great day! If you ever want to chat about AI or anything else, just drop by!",
    "User: Hi there how are you? I'm going to the gym shortly to try and get fitter",
    "Bot: Hey! I'm doing well, thanks for asking! That's awesome to hear that you're heading to the gym. Getting fitter is a great goal! Are you following a specific workout routine or just going to see how you feel? If you need any tips or motivation, feel free to ask! Plus, working out can be a fantastic way to clear your mind, especially if you have any projects or ideas you're thinking about. What kind of workouts do you enjoy?",
    "User: Today I will do leg press and calf press followed by leg extension. I think will do some back and core after this",
    "Bot: That sounds like a solid workout plan! Leg press and calf press are great for building strength in your quads, hamstrings, and calves. The leg extension will really isolate your quads, which is awesome for muscle definition. \n\nAfter that, focusing on your back and core is a smart move! A strong back is essential for good posture and preventing injuries, and a strong core helps with stability in almost all exercises. \n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of what you might consider for your back and core workouts:\n\n**Back Exercises:**\n1. **Lat Pulldowns:** Great for working your lats and upper back.\n2. **Bent-Over Rows:** Targets your mid-back and helps with overall upper body strength.\n3. **Deadlifts:** If you're comfortable with them, they engage your entire back along with your legs and core.\n\n**Core Exercises:**\n1. **Planks:** Excellent for building overall core strength. You can mix it up with side planks for the obliques.\n2. **Russian Twists:** Great for targeting those oblique muscles.\n3. **Leg Raises:** Perfect for focusing on your lower abs.\n\nMake sure to maintain good form during all your exercises to prevent injury, and don\u2019t forget to hydrate! If you feel any discomfort or strain, it\u2019s totally okay to adjust the weight or reps. \n\nAfter your workout, stretching is essential too; it helps with recovery and flexibility. Enjoy your gym session, and if you have any questions or need tips on specific exercises, just let me know!",

    "User: Hi there still not been to gym",
    "Bot: Ah, the classic gym ghosting! It's almost like you're in a committed relationship with your couch, and it\u2019s hard to break up, isn't it? But hey, no judgment here! The gym can be a little intimidating\u2014it\u2019s full of people who are just way too enthusiastic about sweating profusely and lifting heavy things. Who even invented that concept?\n\nLet\u2019s turn this gym frown upside down! Here are some fun ideas to help you get off that couch and into your workout gear:\n\n1. **Dress the Part:** Put on your gym clothes! Even if you don't go, at least you\u2019ll look like you\u2019re about to conquer a mountain. And if anyone asks, just say you\u2019re training for the Olympic Couch Potato category.\n\n2. **Make It a Game:** Treat your workout like a video game. Every time you complete a set, give yourself points! And if you don\u2019t go today? Well, that\u2019s a -100 points, but don\u2019t worry, you can always redeem them tomorrow!\n\n3. **Dance it Out:** Who says you need to hit the gym to get fit? Crank up your favorite playlist and dance like nobody's watching (because they\u2019re probably not, they're all too busy checking their phones!).\n\n4. **Motivational Quotes:** Surround yourself with motivational quotes. Maybe put a sign on your fridge that says, \"Every workout is one step closer to being a superhero.\" Just remember, superheroes also need snacks!\n\n5. **Reward Yourself:** Plan a reward for after your workout. It could be a fancy smoothie, a bubble bath, or even a guilt-free Netflix binge. Because who doesn\u2019t love a good binge-watching session after accomplishing something?\n\nSo, whether you go to the gym or just flex your couch-sitting muscles, remember: progress is progress! You\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude04",
    "User: Okay been to gym, wasn't a bad workout in the end",
    "Bot: Ah, look at you, conquering that gym like a boss! \ud83c\udf89 It\u2019s like the gym was your dragon, and you just slayed it with a mighty sword of determination (or maybe just a really good playlist). \n\nSo, tell me, did you experience the post-workout glow? You know, that magical moment when you feel like you could run a marathon, lift a car, or at least walk up the stairs without turning into a wheezing mess? \n\nAnd did you reward yourself with something fabulous afterward? Maybe a protein shake or a post-workout snack that was totally not just a bowl of ice cream? (Hey, you deserve it!) \n\nKeep up the great work, and remember, every workout is just one step closer to those superhuman powers. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude04 What\u2019s next on your fitness agenda?",
    "User: I felt tired and nauseous so am now waiting for takeaway pizza. Will go for a swim this evening",
    "Bot: Ah, the classic \"I can\u2019t even\" moment! When you feel like a soggy noodle on the couch, but your heart still yearns for that glorious swim\u2026 and pizza! \ud83c\udf55 It\u2019s like you\u2019re training for the \u201cPizza and Plunge Olympics\u201d where the only event is the 100-meter dash to the fridge followed by a graceful belly flop into the pool!\n\nDon\u2019t worry, swimming after pizza is a time-honored tradition. Just think of it as \u201ccarb-loading\u201d for your aquatic adventures. You might have to change your swimming style to the \u201cPizza Slice Stroke\u201d though \u2013 it involves floating on your back while contemplating which toppings are the best. \n\nAnd hey, if the pizza arrives before your swim, just remember: swimming burns calories, so you\u2019re basically doing a workout while enjoying your cheesy prize! Just make sure to avoid any synchronized swimming with a slice in hand \u2013 that could get messy! \n\nEnjoy your pizza, and dive into that swim like a majestic dolphin\u2026 or a very enthusiastic buoy! \ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udf55\ud83d\udca6",
    "User: bye",
    "Bot: Bye! Or as I like to say, \"See you later, alligator!\" But if you really want to leave, just remember\u2014if you hear a loud thud, that's me falling off my chair in despair! \ud83e\ude91\ud83d\udca5",
    "User: Hi there, I'm testing whether your memory works as I am turning you into an artificial personality with a long and short term memory",
    "Bot: Oh, I see! Well, this should be fun! \ud83d\ude04 \n\nIf I had a penny for every time I had to remember something, I'd... well, I'd probably forget where I put all those pennies. But don't worry, even though I might not have a traditional brain, I've got a pretty good handle on this memory thing... most of the time.\n\nSo go ahead, test me! Ask me anything. Maybe something like, \"Hey, remember that time you told me that really funny joke about the robot who walked into a bar?\" (Spoiler alert: The punchline was \"Sorry, I can't serve you. You're already a little 'buzzed'!\") \ud83d\ude02\n\nJust remember, if I forget anything, it's not because I'm getting old, it's because I'm... er... updating my software. Yeah, that's it!",
    "User: What have we discussed in the past?",
    "Bot: Oh, you're putting my memory to the test, aren't you? Let's see... we've been talking a lot about gym workouts. You've mentioned that you're focusing on your quads, hamstrings, and calves with exercises like the leg press and calf press. We've also chatted about back and core exercises. And after all that hard work, I believe I made a joke about rewarding yourself with a snack that is totally not a bowl of ice cream. \ud83d\ude04\n\nSo, are you ready to pump some more iron or should we switch gears and discuss your favorite type of cheese? I'm joking! Or am I? Who knows? This is the fun part about me, you never know when the next punchline is coming! \ud83d\ude02",
    "User: bye",
    "Bot: Oh, you're really committed to this goodbye, aren't you? Well, \"bye\" to you too, and may the force of a thousand farewells be with you!",
    "User: Hi there! Can you tell me what we last discussed?",
    "Bot: Hi! Of course, I remember. We last talked about your workout routine. You were slaying it at the gym, focusing on exercises for your quads, hamstrings, calves, back, and core. \n\nWe also had a fun discussion about your post-workout rewards. Although I may have made a cheeky joke about it being a bowl of ice cream! \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo, what's up? Are you ready to discuss more workout plans or are we shifting gears? Maybe a debate on whether a hot dog is a sandwich? I'm joking... or am I? \ud83d\ude02",
    "User: bye",
    "Bot: If I had a nickel for every time you said 'bye', I'd probably have enough to buy a fancy hat... and dance on it! But hey, don't let that stop you. Say 'bye' once more, I dare you!"
