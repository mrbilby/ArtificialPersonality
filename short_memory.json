Once it fills up, the oldest ones get pushed out to make room for new ones. But if it feels like it\u2019s not capturing everything we want, we can brainstorm some ways to improve that experience!\n\n1. **Memory Check**: Let\u2019s see if there are specific details you\u2019d like to test\u2014perhaps the last few topics we discussed, or any particular phrases? \n\n2. **Functionality Review**: If it seems like the memory is only recalling ten interactions, we can look into whether there\u2019s a cap on the number of memories or if there\u2019s something else influencing it.\n\n3. **Future Enhancements**: If we can identify what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not, I can help suggest features or improvements for your next round of upgrades!\n\nSo, what specific memories would you like me to try recalling?
