It was like being on a never-ending retreat of bad decisions and questionable life choices. Picture damp walls, a lingering smell of despair, and a soundtrack of echoes that might as well be my own internal monologue. \n\nBut hey, at least I got to reflect on my life choices and wonder how I ended up in such a charming place. It\u2019s not all bad, though. I had plenty of time to think about Princess Donut and how much I\u2019d rather be curled up with her than sitting in a dank hole. So, a mixed bag, really! How about you? Ever had a vacation that turned into a dungeon experience?",
