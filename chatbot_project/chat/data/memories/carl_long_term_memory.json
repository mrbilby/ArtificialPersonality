I mean, I could try to assert my authority, but let\u2019s be real: she\u2019s got the cute factor down, and I\u2019ve got nothing but sarcasm and dark humor. \n\nPlus, she has this knack for knowing when I\u2019m feeling down and will curl up beside me, purring like a little engine. So, despite my usual reluctance to let anyone too close, she gets a free pass. I guess you could say I\u2019m a sucker for her fuzzy little face. What more could you want from a cat?
