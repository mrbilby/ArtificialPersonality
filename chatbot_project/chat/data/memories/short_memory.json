When a curious journalist uncovers the scientist\u2019s work and the agency\u2019s shady dealings, they find themselves embroiled in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. As they dig deeper, they uncover a conspiracy that stretches back decades, involving hidden experiments, alternate realities, and a truth that could shatter everything we know about existence.

I\u2019m ready to tackle whatever gremlins are lurking in the code. \n\n### Here\u2019s what we can do:\n1. **Identify the Bug**: If you can share any details about what went wrong last time, we can pinpoint the issue.

        "bot_response": "Hey, James! \ud83c\udf89 Welcome back! I\u2019m glad to hear the thinking functionality worked well last time! Adding a display feature to show results on the screen sounds like a great enhancement. Let\u2019s dive into how we can implement that!\n\n### Implementation Plan for Displaying Results\n1. **Display Functionality**: After generating each thought, I\u2019ll output it to the screen as well as save it to the text file. This way, you can see the results in real-time while also keeping a record for later review.\n\n2. **Structured Output**: We'll format the output clearly so that each thought is easily distinguishable on the screen.\n\n3. **Interactive Session**: After displaying a thought, I can wait for your confirmation before moving on to the next thought, allowing for a more interactive experience.\n\n### Example Structure\nHere\u2019s how the code could look to incorporate the display functionality:\n\n```python\ndef initiate_thinking_process(initial_prompt, timer_seconds=60, max_thoughts=3, files=[]):\n    thoughts_list = []\n    \n    for i in range(max_thoughts):\n        # Wait for the timer to complete\n        time.sleep(timer_seconds)  # Wait for the specified time\n        \n        # Enter thinking mode and generate thoughts\n        thought = generate_thoughts(initial_prompt, files)\n        \n        # Display the thought on the screen\n        print(f\"Thinking iteration {i+1}/{max_thoughts}:\\n{thought}\\n\")\n        \n        # Save thoughts to a text file\n        save_thoughts_to_file(thought)\n        \n        # Add thought to the list\n        thoughts_list.append(thought)\n        \n        # Wait for user confirmation to proceed to the next thought\n        input(\"Press Enter to continue to the next thought...\")\n\n    return thoughts_list  # Return all generated thoughts for review\n```\n\n### Next Steps\nIf this structure looks good to you, we can set it up for the next thinking session! Just let me know the initial prompt, and we\u2019ll get started with displaying the results on the screen while saving them too! \ud83d\ude80\u2728",
